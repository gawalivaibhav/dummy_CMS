# Dummy Charging Management System (CMS) Server

This repository contains a simple, dummy Charging Management System (CMS) server prototype. It was built using **Goose AI** to demonstrate rapid development and prototyping capabilities.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to simulate the core functionalities of a CMS provider for testing and development purposes.

The implemented features include:

-   **Start Charging:** Simulate the initiation of a charging session.
-   **Stop Charging:** Simulate the termination of a charging session.
-   **List Sessions/Transactions:** View a list of recorded charging sessions or transactions.

## Built with Goose AI

This prototype was developed rapidly leveraging the integrated tools provided by Goose AI, specifically the `developer__shell` for executing commands (like installing dependencies and running the server) and the `developer__text_editor` for writing and modifying the Python code.

The use of Goose streamlined the development workflow and allowed for quick iteration and debugging, including resolving a technical challenge related to WebSocket implementation by switching frameworks from `flask-sockets` to `quart`.

## Getting Started

*(Note: Detailed setup instructions can be added here later if needed, but for this simple README, we'll keep it brief)*

To run this project, you would typically need Python installed. Dependencies can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install quart websockets
```

You can then run the server script.

```bash
python server.py # Or whatever your main server file is named
```

*(Replace `server.py` with the actual name of your main server file)*
